**project description**

my assignment was tocreate an interactive page where users can add and 

remove photos, like photos of other users, and make a few minor adjustments to their own profile.


my biggest challenge was to design responsive page to each screen , and 

my solution was to use grid layout , even that was new to me and my 

first time using it in A project  i took this challenge beacuse i know 

it was  effective.


**project conclustion**

This was a good practice working with the new technology

that i learn like grid layout, media queries, figma design , i feel 

more cofidence dealing with that kind of projects.
